# Bounce-Back-Campaign-Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and findings related to World Vision Australia's "Bounceback Campaign." The project aims to enhance donor engagement, optimize communication channels, and increase donations through data-driven strategies.

## Files Overview

* **`stream_selection_analysis.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook performs data loading, cleaning, and analysis related to stream selection for the Bounceback campaign. It includes steps for handling missing values and preparing the data for modeling.
* **`final_analysis_report.pdf`**: This PDF document is the final report prepared by Team 6 for Deakin University, detailing a comprehensive analysis of the Bounceback Campaign. It covers descriptive analysis, predictive modeling (including journey optimization and dollar ask analysis), and provides strategic recommendations for long-term donor engagement.
<!-- * **`journey_optimisation_raw.csv`**: The raw dataset containing campaign and donor information used for the analysis. -->

## Analysis Highlights

* **Descriptive Analysis**: Insights into donor behavior across various campaign phases (Offline Main, Online Main, eDM1, eDM2), highlighting the effectiveness of different communication strategies. Offline campaigns generally performed better in terms of engagement and average donations.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Application of models to maximize journey gaps, forecast stream allocation, and personalize donation requests. Machine learning models were used to determine an ideal donation base amount of $41.86.
* **Key Findings**: Offline campaign phases yielded higher average donations and donor engagement compared to online channels, despite online channels being more cost-effective.
* **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving digital experiences, utilizing dynamic communication intervals, and encouraging real-time donation suggestions for long-term engagement.
